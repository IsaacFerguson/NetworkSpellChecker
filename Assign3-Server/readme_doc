Program design:
	This Program has two components the first is the client the other is the server. The server is the
	driving factor behind the code. The servers job is to connect and sort clients into threads that 
	allow the clients to use the networked spellchecker. The server also stores a log of all the data 
	being sent to clients. The client simply conntects to the server and sends words to be checked.

Testing, Results, Debugging:
	besides syntactical errors I had some trouble with the mutex and cond vari. I was a little confused
	on how they work and had some problems with calling the wrong lock or vari but eventaully they all 
	worked. The other problems I had were around the log file and the spell checker. All of the threads
	were created and worked properly but the writing to the log file and checking of words has issues. 
	The log file would recive the correct info but would not write it to the log file. For the spellchecker
	the loop i wrote seemed to go over every word but would only work on certain words. The words that worked
	seemed to be shorter words.

		Words that worked:
			yes
			hail
			happy
			hello
			no
			pipe
			lire
			dire
		Words that did not work:
			computer
			superstar
			eighteenth
			elegantly

Discussion and Analysis:
	Overall this project had some hard new concepts but if I had been better with time mangement I could have turned 
	this in working and on time. Due to running out of time i never switched the FIFO queue for the socket buffer
	to a priority queue.
